  <h1>Thoughts on COVID</h1>
  <!-- My reflection of myself before COVID lockdown -->

  <hr>

  <h2>Before COVID...</h2>
  <p>Looking back on who I was pre-COVID, I had a lot of realization about myself that allowed me
  to grow. <br> Before COVID, I was on an entirely different career path, surrounded myself with very different people,
  and had struggling relationships with people who were close to me. </p>

  <h2>Since COVID...</h2>
  <!-- My thoughts following covid lockdown -->
  <p>I find myself to be in a much better place. I'm pursuing a different career path that I absolutely love. I have
  great relationships with everyone close to me. I have a great group of friends that align well with my own values and aspirations.
  And although, this was not true during the Winter of 2020, when in lockdown, my mental health has also proved to be much better.
  I hope to continue to grow and learn. </p>
